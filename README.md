Grateful Moments is a simple app, but a very meaningful one for me: it lets you collect those special moments you’re grateful for, see the date each moment was created, attach a photo if you’d like, and delete it whenever you no longer want to keep it.
The key part of building this project was integrating SwiftData, which allowed me to understand in practice how data persistence works in iOS: how to define my model, save new records, and safely update or delete them. Without SwiftData, these “gratitude moments” would simply be lost every time you close the app.
